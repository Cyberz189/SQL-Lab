                                                      APPLYING FILTERS TO SQL QUERIES




Using SQL to query a database for login attempts allows for detailed analysis of login activities, including information such as country, usernames, dates, and departments. By constructing SQL queries with appropriate conditions and joins, it becomes possible to retrieve specific login data based on various criteria. For example, querying by country can help identify the geographical origin of login attempts, while querying by usernames and dates can provide insights into user behavior and patterns. Additionally, querying by departments enables organizations to track login activities associated with specific departments, facilitating targeted security measures and monitoring. Overall, leveraging SQL for database queries empowers organizations to conduct comprehensive analyses of login attempts, aiding in cybersecurity efforts and ensuring the integrity of their systems.
